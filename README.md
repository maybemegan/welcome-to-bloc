### My skills
Perhaps the most important aspect of success stories is persistance. When faced with adversity, successful people will commit to solving the problem and use all available resources to overcome the challenge. I share this trait of persistance and it is a key part of my educational habits and professional experience. When I decide to commit time to something, whether it is a Bachelor's degree or a company, I commit fully. In a perfect world I would be working through this program and solely this for the next few months, however, this is not the case. I work full time and have many obligations, so I already know my greatest challenge will be reorganizing my habits to make sure I have enough time to dedicate. I understand the keys to success and their importance, most of them I regularly embrace in my day-to-day work: I put in my 8-9 hours, I don't allow myself to lose momentum on my priorities, I collaborate with other team members and involve my manager when I get stuck, I persist through the lows and celebrate the highs, and I forage all the time. 

The challenge for me will be to push through the exhaustion late at night or to wake up before dawn to make time to learn these new skills. However, I listen to enough podcasts about successful people and companies to know this has been done before time and time again. I'm not unique in this regard, and I am already working to restructure my habits to ensure I will be successful in this program.
